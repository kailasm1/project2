# Breast Cancer Detection ML Model

 

This program builds and evaluates machine learning models for breast cancer detection using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

 

## Description

 

The program loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains machine learning models using different algorithms, and evaluates their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 

## Features

 

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate model performance
- Save trained models to files

 

## Requirements

 

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib

 

## Usage

 

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
